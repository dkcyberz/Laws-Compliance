What is Mitre Attack?

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a comprehensive and widely used tool for understanding and categorizing cyber adversary behavior. 
Developed by the MITRE Corporation.

Terms of the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Tactics:

Tactics represent the "why" of an attack technique. They are the adversary's tactical objectives—the reasons for performing an action. 

Techniques:

Techniques describe the "how" of an attack. They are the specific methods adversaries use to achieve their tactical objectives. 
Each tactic can have multiple techniques associated with it.

Sub-Techniques:

These provide additional granularity and detail within a technique. For example, the technique "Phishing" might have sub-techniques like 
"Spearphishing Attachment" and "Spearphishing Link."

Procedures:

Procedures are the specific implementation of techniques or sub-techniques used by threat actors. 
These are detailed descriptions of how specific groups or malware utilize techniques.


Mitre Attack Tactics

The MITRE ATT&CK framework outlines a set of tactics that represent the strategic objectives adversaries pursue during various stages of a cyber attack.

Initial Access:

Techniques that adversaries use to gain initial access to a network. 
Examples include spearphishing, exploiting public-facing applications, and supply chain compromises.


Execution:

Methods by which adversaries run malicious code on a system. Techniques include command and scripting interpreter, 
exploitation for client execution, and scheduled tasks.

Persistence:

Techniques aimed at maintaining a foothold on the system. Examples include creating new user accounts, modifying existing services, 
and implanting malicious code in startup items.

Privilege Escalation:

Techniques that enable adversaries to gain higher-level permissions on a system. Methods include bypassing user account control, 
exploiting vulnerabilities, and manipulating access tokens.

Defense Evasion:

Methods used to avoid detection and evade security measures. Techniques include obfuscating files or information, disabling security tools, 
and using trusted processes to execute malicious code.

Credential Access:

Techniques that allow adversaries to steal credentials such as account names and passwords. Examples include keylogging, credential dumping, and 
brute force attacks.

Discovery:

Techniques for gaining knowledge about the system and network environment. These include network scanning, system information discovery, and 
account discovery.

Lateral Movement:

Techniques for moving through a network. Methods include using remote services, exploiting remote systems, 
and using stolen credentials to access other systems.

Collection:

Techniques for gathering information and sensitive data from the target environment. Examples include capturing screenshots, keylogging, 
and data from local system storage.

Command and Control (C2):

Techniques for communicating with compromised systems. These include using C2 servers, encrypted channels, and web service-based C2.

Exfiltration:

Techniques for stealing data from a target network. Methods include using automated tools, exfiltration over alternative protocol, 
and scheduled transfer.

Impact:

Techniques that affect the integrity and availability of systems and data. Examples include data destruction, service stop, and resource hijacking.
